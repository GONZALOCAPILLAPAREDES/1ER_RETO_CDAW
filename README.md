This challenge consists in an automatic learning competition. The task is to use the techniques learned in class, applying them to a competition with the aim of obtaining the best model. To this end, a dataset of SME enterprises that have applied for a loan is provided, and their mission will be to build a classifier that determines whether the loan should be granted or denied.

In this challenge the students must take the role of a bank, and formulate the following question: As a representative of the bank, should I grant a loan to a particular small business (Company X)? Why or why not? The student makes this decision by assessing a loan's risk.
